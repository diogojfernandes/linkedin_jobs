We used our advanced analytics tools to build a mathematical model that explains how the volume is transferred between products after a price change. We combined results which allowed us to build a simulator in which the client could test how much volume they would lose or gain (including re-capture effect on other products from their portfolio) after they executed price changes.

Promo Building a transparency tool to analyze effectiveness of promo events for a client in Consumer Packaged Goods (FMCG). We consolidated a clients internal and external datasets and built a standardized  dynamic visualization / transparency tool to analyze historical effectiveness of promo events and drivers of performance. The result was new promo guidelines and updated promo calendars for the upcoming year  enabling the client to maximize their ROI and volume uplift. The transparency and planning tool enabled continuous and holistic review of performance as well as tailoring promo plans in order to allocate the promo investment in the most effective way.

At DSV we are looking for a Data Engineer to be part of our Data & Analytics team in Global IT. The focus of our team is to build advanced end-2-end solutions that create direct business value for DSVs divisions  including for example: customs declaration automation; vendor invoices automation; address validation; ETA prediction; and many more to come

The word advanced is used to underline that the use cases we solve tend to have a high degree of complexity  requiring non-deterministic problem solving (i.e. the use of ML/AI)  near real-time data processing  a need for high availability  vertical and horizontal scalability and a very high volume of transactions. However  fancy technologies and accurate ML models do not solve the issues at hand alone; we strive to combine our competencies to build holistic solutions where the underlying complexity is hidden for the user to create simple and value-adding experiences.

As a Data Engineer your main responsibilities and activities will be:
Sourcing data from systems in DSV via the appropriate pattern for the use case (e.g. REST services  event streaming) or in the beginning of projects before the real integration is established (e.g. simple file dumps on FTP servers)
Building near real-time event streaming data flows with separated micro services for different functional purposes (e.g. file upload  image extraction  file extraction  etc.)
Re-configure the event streaming broker for optimization
Establish domain-based ontologies for data to ensure semantic interoperability between different systems
Making data available in the needed form to use in ML models and for visualization by business applications with a frontend  and collect the inputs of the users as data enrichment from the frontend
Ensuring scalability of data flows by removing bottlenecks
Working together with the logging team  who set guidelines for how to structure your log outputs
We expect you to have experience with most of the following technologies:
Event streaming: Confluent Kafka  Kafka streams  KSQL
Logging & Monitoring: Elastic  Kibana  Grafana  Logstash  FluentD
Coding languages: Python  Java  Scala
Storage technologies such as:
SQL database: We use MySQL
NoSQL database: We use MongoDB

At DSV we are looking for a Data scientist with business understanding to be part of our Data & Analytics team in Global IT. The focus of our team is to build advanced end-2-end solutions that create direct business value for DSVs divisions  including for example: customs declaration automation; vendor invoices automation; address validation; ETA prediction; and many more to come

The word advanced is used to underline that the use cases we solve tend to have a high degree of complexity  requiring non-deterministic problem solving (i.e. the use of ML/AI)  near real-time data processing  a need for high availability  vertical and horizontal scalability and a very high volume of transactions. However  fancy technologies and accurate ML models do not solve the issues at hand alone; we strive to combine our competencies to build holistic solutions where the underlying complexity is hidden for the user to create simple and value-adding experiences.

As a Data Scientist your main responsibilities and activities will be:
Meeting with stakeholders  discussing their needs and translating them into Data Science problems.
Conduct data-driven analyses to provide input to decisions (e.g. which DSV country to start with for a specific use case).
Identify proper solutions / models / pre-trained models for particular business cases.
Preprocess the data (cleaning  transforming) for ML models.
Train ML models on prepared training data using GPU on cloud and on premises.
Test and evaluate ML models and present conclusions on further improvements.
Use and tweak existing frameworks for running automated testing and evaluation of ML models.

We expect you to have experience with most of the following technologies/areas:
Code languages: Python (using both OOP as well as popular libraries such as Pandas  Scikit) 
Solid understanding of Machine Learning in practice: be able to speak about several projects you participated in 
Very good knowledge of Deep Learning with focus on NLP: Transformers  Bert family and where it all came from 
ML Frameworks: TensorFlow / PyTorch and other open-source frameworks 
ML model serving: TensorFlow serving  Torch serving 
Cloud: Azure 
Modern software development: good understanding of DevOps  CI/CD  MLOps 
Basic knowledge of database technologies such as:
Relational database: We use MySQL
NoSQL database: We use MongoDB
Version control: Git (we use Atlassian BitBucket as a GUI on top of Git)
It Is a Bonus If You Also Have Some Experience With Some Of The Other Technologies That Our Team Works With  Such As
Code languages: Java  Scala
Authentication: Open ID Connect 2.0 (we use Red Hat KeyCloak as identity broker)
Containerization: Docker
Container orchestration: Kubernetes
CI/CD Pipelines: Jenkins (our templates are written in Groovy)
Load balancing: NGINX
Installation scripts: Ansible
Event streaming: Confluent Kafka  K streams
Requirements: Jira
Documentation: Confluence
Frontend technologies: React JS  Material UI  JavaScript/TypeScript  Redux
Test framework: Jest
You Like To
Learn new stuff from knowledgeable colleagues
Analyze problems using data and statistics
Present your results to teammates and business stakeholders to communicate your findings
Solve problems that are too complex for deterministic reasoning with the use of Machine Learning
Find pragmatic solutions that balance the need between what is the optimal solution from a theoretical standpoint with what is possible within the constraints set by project deadlines  low data quality  etc.
Understand the data and the business logic that is related to the ML models you test  train and improve  and you believe that this in-depth understanding is pivotal for being able to deliver valuable results
Take a lot of responsibility  both for exciting R&D work to push the boundaries of ML  but also for doing the necessary nitty gritty work it takes to prepare data  evaluate results  debug errors  etc.
Ensure that your models can be tested iteratively to compare the individual models accuracy and the entire solutions accuracy over time and to make this visible to stakeholders
Break down the solutions into iterations so they can deliver value quickly in MVP versions before they are enriched with more nice-to-have functionality in later iterations
Reach out to others for help or clarifications whenever you need it and to ensure alignment with others
Make realistic mockups of data to allow you to test things swiftly on synthetic data before you get access to production data
We Are An Ambitious Team With a Flat Hierarchy And a Mix Of Young And Very Experienced Persons  Who Are Working According To The Following Principles
We celebrate victories together
We take responsibility for mistakes and learn from them
We design for scale but build only for the near future
We value working software and informal alignment over tedious documentation
We make decisions based on knowledge and insight rather than hierarchical structures
Decisions are the product of conversations between people with different competencies (not one person)
Everyone can speak their honest opinion
We have all the needed competencies to build awesome products inside the team: Product owner  Business analysts  Application developers (frontend + backend)  Data engineers  Data scientists  ML engineers  DevOps engineers.
